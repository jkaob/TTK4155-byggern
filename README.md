This term project aims for creating a computer controlled electromechanical ping pong game. The electronic components, game boards and development tools needed to realize the game will behanded out in the beginning of the semester. The main challenge will be to assemble the hardware components and develop software for the microcontrollers, making a fully functional embedded computer system that will enable you to play a refreshing game of pingpong.The term project is in essence a rather comprehensive laboratory exercise which requires allocation of a _substantial_ amount of time for lab workt hroughout the semester.
